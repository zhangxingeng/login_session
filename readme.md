ReadMe:

Hello Team! This is the latest html structure we have!
Please stop wasting time and start to read and contribute to this project!
Your contribution will be shown on github, and will be sent along with the project to Instructor.

I have split our work into several parts and please tell me by 16th which part you plan to work on.
Do not expect others to do your job! We are a team and should do this together.

Job Assignment:
	1. Database.--Xingeng has finished with a structure and please finish the (1.table creation) and (2. instance creation)
		by 17th. Zhonghao Wu will do the table creation and Zhiweigao do the instance creation. Please contact Xingeng 
		Zhang personally if you have any questions. The file is uploaded and shared via google drive The link will be attached 
		at the bottom.
	2. Web site structure--by structure I mean HTML code. Xingeng and Haoran has finished the login part of the web page, and will
		keep doing the rest--which includes a home page, a cart page, a checkout page, and search result page. This job will be 
		handled by Haoran Wen since he is really interested in html.
	3. connection--finally we need to figure out how to connect the database and the web site: login, search and cart creation all 
		needs this technique. I, Xingeng Zhang will take this job, since I am already doing this.
Extra Notes:
	1. please always read through all the code others have written and ask the responsible person, because it helps you to learn. And 
		it also connect and make sense of the work we are doing. People who wrote the code is also responsible to explain it to others. 
	2. please make sure all attributes and table names are used universally! The file Xingeng created has a schema and that should 
		always be the name of all attributes written in all other places because when coding, these names are used to retrieve data, 
		once they are wrong, unexpected error will occur and it will take many time to figure it out.

All Relavant Files has been put inside of this project. Mysql related informations are stored inside 336_project_database_constructor.rtf


/************added on 17/04/2019***********/

For everyone:
To do: based on the structure of login_handler, we can now create servlets with the endings of _handler in request_handler package.
We need to discuss who to do which.
All data objects are stored in data package, and has the attribute of data, and all variables inside should have the same name as 
the attribute name in Mysql database.



For Haoran Wen
Besides, We still need a page that shows the items of one person(which includes alert and questions)
and a page for customer reps. This jsp file should be uploaded by Haoran. Notice: when create a form, please try to combine as much
options into one form, which means less servlets will need to be created.
